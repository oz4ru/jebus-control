# Details
Inspired by Jebus Cross but modified to allow extensive control play thanks to divided "desert", stronger guards between players and alternative paths for attack.

To reduce randomness:
* Jebus Cross zones were splitted  into smaller chunks to reduce connections randomness and make map layout repeatable
* "Side" zones are always grass
* First "side" town after 15k break is always Conflux to allow guaranteed access to Earth/Air Magic
